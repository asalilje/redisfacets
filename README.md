# redisfacets
A demo web using MVC and Redis to do faceted filtering

A slightly modified MVC-solution using a custom view engine to change structure of the solution to use the concept of features instead of tech layer (Models, Views, Controllers).

Redis db to model data in the key-value format needed for the use case; filtering using facets.

Gulp to build and watch changes in Less and ES2015-files.
